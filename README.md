Hereâ€™s how you can build a **Blazor WebAssembly application** for EventEase with the following requirements:

- Browse events with details (event name, date, and location).
- Navigation between pages like event details and registration.
- Use a reusable Event Card Component to display event details.
- Include validation with data annotations for event registration.

**This implementation includes**:
- A reusable Event Card Component.  
- Data annotation-based validation for registration.  
- Local JSON files for data storage.
